title: Proposal Lifecycle
description: Stages of a proposal from submission to execution
---

## Phase 1: Community Deliberation - 30 Days

- Proposers submit proposals using standardized templates on the Web5 governance platform.
- After submission, proposals automatically enter a 30-day public community deliberation period. During this time, all community members can discuss under the proposal.
- DAO Stewards should promote broad coverage of project information and community discussions during this period:
    - Organize at least 2 public Q&A sessions for the community. If multiple projects are applying simultaneously, Q&A sessions can be combined and ordered by proposal submission time.
    - Weekly summaries of community discussions, Q&A, and proposer responses are synchronized on the Nervos Talk Community Fund DAO section and various CKB community social platforms.
- During the deliberation period, proposers can continuously refine their proposal content.
- **Passing Condition:** No threshold is set for this phase. After completing the 30-day deliberation period, the proposer can choose whether to proceed to the next phase.

---

## Phase 2: Project Voting - 7 Days

- **Initiation Requirement:** Proposers must hold at least 100,000 CKB in Nervos DAO to initiate voting on the Web5 governance platform.
- **Voting Mechanism:** Voting weight is entirely based on users' CKB deposits in Nervos DAO, continuing the direct weighted voting model from v1.0.
- **Passing Conditions:** Following v1.0 core logic
    - **Budget Proposals:** Approval votes ≥ 51%, and total participating CKB must be at least 3 times the requested budget.
    - **Meta-rule Amendment Proposals:** Approval votes ≥ 67%, and total participating CKB must be at least 185,000,000 CKB.

## Phase 3: Execution Oversight

### Project Startup

After a proposal passes, the DAO treasury and project execution wallet will proceed with startup funding allocation.

### Milestone Oversight

- All proposals involving fund usage are paid in phases, with initial funding limited to 20% of the total budget, with a maximum cap of $10,000.
- Proposals with total budgets exceeding $10,000 must specify milestones and pay by milestone.
- After each milestone delivery, DAO Stewards must publish a verification report within 7 days.
- After the report is published, subsequent funding requires a quick confirmation vote by the community before execution.
- **Quick Confirmation Vote Description:** To balance governance efficiency with community oversight and avoid voting fatigue and superficial governance, quick voting adopts an "**optimistic governance**" model of "**default pass with community veto power**":
    - **Voting Duration**: 3 days
    - **Voting Options**: Confirm Funding VS Reject Funding
    - **Minimum Voting Threshold**:
        - Not less than the project's requested budget (Budget Proposals)
        - Not less than 185,000,000/3 = 62,000,000 CKB (Meta-rule Amendment Proposals)
        - The minimum voting threshold here is 1/3 of the project approval threshold, considering the objective fact that community attention naturally decreases during project progress, allowing DAO members who continue to follow progress to act as "whistleblowers," pausing the process to draw community attention and enter subsequent review
    - **Decision Threshold and Results:** Given the minimum voting threshold is met, if Reject Funding ≥ 51% (Budget Proposals) or ≥ 67% (Meta-rule Amendment Proposals), funding is rejected; otherwise, funding automatically passes
- If a project has no milestones, the closing report and payment follow milestone procedures.

### Project Review, Final Decision, and Termination (Crisis Handling)

Review process after funding rejection during milestone oversight:

1. Once funding is rejected, the milestone is paused, and that milestone's funds and subsequent funds are immediately frozen.
2. The DAO Stewards team must organize an emergency community meeting within 48 hours to facilitate open dialogue between the project team and opposing voters to clarify issues.
3. After the dialogue, DAO Stewards compile meeting minutes and request a community review vote:
    - **Voting Duration:** 7 days
    - **Voting Options:** Terminate Project and Recover Remaining Funds VS Continue After Resolving Issues
    - **Minimum Voting Threshold**: Same as proposal approval
        - Not less than 3 times the project's total requested budget (Budget Proposals)
        - Not less than 185,000,000 CKB (Meta-rule Amendment Proposals)
    - **Decision Threshold and Results:**
        - Given the minimum voting threshold is met:
            - If "Terminate Project and Recover Remaining Funds" wins (≥ 51% (Budget Proposals) or ≥ 67% (Meta-rule Amendment Proposals)), the project is officially terminated, and all remaining funds are returned to the DAO v1.0 main treasury. The DAO Stewards team issues a project termination report.
            - If "Continue After Resolving Issues" wins, the project resumes normal status, and frozen milestone funds are paid normally.
        - If the vote fails (minimum voting threshold not met, etc.), this result indicates the community has not yet reached consensus on immediate termination. To respect the rejection result from milestone oversight, milestone funds remain frozen and the project enters a **30-day rectification period**, during which a detailed rectification proposal must be submitted. After the rectification period expires, the community will conduct a final decision vote.

4. After the 30-day rectification period, DAO Stewards organize a final decision vote. To balance governance efficiency with community oversight, this vote adopts a "**pessimistic governance**" model of "**default failure with community approval power**," where the project team must proactively regain community trust:
    - **Voting Duration**: 7 days
    - **Voting Options**: Approve Rectification Proposal VS Reject Rectification Proposal
    - **Minimum Voting Threshold**:
        - Not less than 3 times the project's total requested budget (Budget Proposals)
        - Not less than 185,000,000 CKB (Meta-rule Amendment Proposals)
    - **Decision Threshold and Results:**
        - Given the minimum voting threshold is met:
            - If Approve Rectification Proposal wins (≥ 51% (Budget Proposals) or ≥ 67% (Meta-rule Amendment Proposals)), the project is considered "Continue After Resolving Issues," previously frozen milestone funds are immediately paid to the project team, and the project resumes normal status
            - If Reject Rectification Proposal wins, the project is officially terminated, handled as "Terminate Project and Recover Remaining Funds"
        - If the vote fails (minimum voting threshold not met, etc.), the project is also automatically officially terminated, handled as "Terminate Project and Recover Remaining Funds"

### Project Completion

Project successfully completed, funds are executed according to the treasury management plan; the Stewards team forms a closing report based on deliverables and project implementation process.

## Status Updates

The Stewards team is responsible for continuously updating project status and fund disbursement records on the public dashboard.
