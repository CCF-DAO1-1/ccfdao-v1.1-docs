## Governance Process Overview

To achieve the goals of DAO v1.1, we propose a new set of governance rules and processes. Building on v1.0, it integrates the role of DAO Stewards and optimizes the entire process from proposal deliberation to execution oversight. All processes are completed on the new Web5 governance platform.

## Governance Scope

Same as DAO v1.0, governance covers two types of matters:

- Making decisions on budget requests for ecosystem development projects.
- Making decisions on modifications to the DAO's governance meta-rules.

---

## General Rules

- **No Proxy Proposals:** All proposals must be submitted by the project lead using their `did:ckb` identity.
- **No Incentivized Voting:** Any form of airdrops or asset incentives in exchange for votes is prohibited.
