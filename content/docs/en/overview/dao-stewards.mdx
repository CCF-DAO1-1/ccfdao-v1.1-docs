## Defining "Stewards"

In everyday language, the term "Steward" is often misunderstood as a manager with ambiguous power boundaries in a residential community, sometimes even perceived as a "ruler" within a specific social organization (especially in the Chinese context) due to various real-world issues. However, from a political and sociological perspective, the work of steward is precisely a **purely procedural service created to solve the collective action problem**.

Modern communities, born from private property rights, have numerous public facilities (like elevators, roads) and public order. Theoretically, these public affairs should be decided upon and maintained by all property owners collectively. In practice, however, it is unrealistic to expect all owners to invest their energy in handling these tedious matters, which is known as the "collective action problem." The emergence of steward, through neutral and professional services, liberates owners from complex public affairs, allowing them to focus on core issues while ensuring the community's normal operation. Its essence is to **be entrusted by all owners to provide professional services, without ever interfering with the owners' sovereignty**.

In the context of a DAO, this model is a perfect fit. CKB stakers are the "owners" of the DAO, possessing the ultimate decision-making power over DAO governance matters such as the use of funds. But it is equally unrealistic to expect everyone to participate in procedural tasks like following up on project progress, verifying code deliverables, and organizing community meetings. The DAO Stewards proposed here are essentially a **professional procedural team serving all "owners," equipped with diverse skills (technical, marketing, research), acting as a neutral service provider to support the daily operations of DAO v1.1**.

## Positioning and Mission

### Team Positioning

The DAO Stewards are a **procedural service and facilitation team** trusted by the community, funded by the DAO, and accountable to all voters.

### Core Mission

As neutral service providers and process facilitators, to provide high-quality operational, oversight, and technical support for community governance.

### Scope of Authority

DAO Stewards do not have the power to approve proposals or make any voting decisions. The objective of all their actions is to ensure the fairness, transparency, and efficiency of the governance process and to present the most complete and neutral information to the community decision-makers.

| Authority Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **No Decision-Making Power** | The DAO Stewards team **does not have** the authority to approve proposals, nor **does it have** any voting decision-making power. They are "servants" of community decision-making and governance, not "approvers." |
| **No Interpretive Power** | The DAO Stewards team **has no authority** to interpret or arbitrate rule disputes; they can only execute procedures strictly according to the written rules approved by the community. |
| **Financial Responsibility** | The Stewards team **has no autonomous financial authority**. Their responsibilities related to funds are limited to:<br/>• After the community votes to approve a project, notifying the main treasury multi-sig holders to transfer the total project budget to the corresponding project execution wallet.<br/>• As multi-sig holders of the project execution wallet, fulfilling the procedural obligation of signing for payment after each milestone is confirmed by a community vote, along with other multi-sig holders. |
| **Personal Voting Rights** | As community members, Stewards retain the right to exercise their personal vote on all proposals based on their voting weight. |

In line with their positioning and mission, the core responsibilities of the DAO Stewards revolve around their procedural authority.

- **Organizing Community Q&A:** Responsible for organizing community AMAs or public debates before a proposal goes to a vote.

### Oversight and Reporting

- **Milestone Verification:** For proposals that have received funding, responsible for verifying their milestone deliverables.
- **Publishing Verification Reports:** Publicly release verification reports to the community at each milestone.

### Transparency and Communication

- **Information Outreach:** Ensure that all important governance information effectively reaches community members.

## Team Formation and Rotation

### Initial Formation

To ensure an efficient and stable launch, the formation of the first DAO Stewards team will be guided by the proposal team. Meanwhile, we will open to the entire CKB community to find the best candidates for the core professional roles within the Stewards.

### Subsequent Elections

After the DAO Stewards team has been operational for one year, fully community-based elections will be initiated. Each term for the Stewards team will be one year.

## Operational Funding

- **Initial Phase:** The operational funds for the DAO Stewards team are proposed within this proposal.
- **Subsequent Phase:** After community-based elections begin, the operational budget for the DAO Stewards team (such as member salaries, tool development fees) should also be applied for from the DAO every year in the form of an independent proposal.

---

## Performance Evaluation and Accountability

- The DAO Stewards will publish a quarterly work report to the community, detailing their work content, service effectiveness, and budget usage.
- The community has the right to initiate a vote of no confidence in the Stewards team at any time, or to vote on whether to renew their service at the end of their term.
