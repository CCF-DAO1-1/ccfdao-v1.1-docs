## What is CKB Community Fund DAO?

**CKB Community Fund DAO** is a community building fund initiated by the Nervos community and jointly promoted with the Nervos Foundation. It is designed to support community members in building and exploring the CKB ecosystem.

Over the past few years, we have clearly seen the valuable contributions emerging from the Nervos community, with many remarkable ideas and high-quality discussions accumulated across various platforms. However, due to limited resources available to individuals or small teams, most of these ideas have not been realized, which is truly regrettable.

Therefore, community teams and the Foundation have jointly raised seed funding for CKB Community Fund DAO through donations, to encourage and fund individuals and teams in the community for project incubation, event organization, and influence building.

On the other hand, as shown in [Nervos DAO](https://explorer.nervos.org/nervosdao), Nervos has considered from day one that it will eventually move towards decentralized governance, with plans to establish a relatively mature mechanism before CKB's second halving. This process will inevitably be long and cautious, and the establishment of CKB Community Fund DAO will contribute valuable governance experience and data to this process.
