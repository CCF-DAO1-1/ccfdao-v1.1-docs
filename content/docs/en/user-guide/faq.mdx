import { Accordion, Accordions } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/accordion';

<Callout title="Terminology Note" type="warning">
For clarity, all references to "deposit", "deposited balance", or "deposit status" in this document refer to CKB that has been deposited into Nervos DAO and is **currently locked**. CKB that has initiated withdrawal or is in circulation does not count toward voting weight.
</Callout>

## Wallet & Connection

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Which wallets are supported?">
The DAO platform is built on [CCC](https://github.com/ckb-devrel/ccc) (Common Chains Connector) and supports the following wallet types:

- **EVM Wallets**: MetaMask, imToken, CoinBase, OKX Wallet, and all EIP-6963 compatible wallets
- **Bitcoin Wallets**: UniSat, Xverse, OKX Wallet, UTXO Global
- **CKB Native Wallets**: JoyID, REI Wallet, UTXO Global Wallet
- **Nostr Wallets**: All NIP-07 compatible wallets
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which wallet do you recommend?">
If you're a new user, we recommend using **JoyID** wallet. JoyID is a multi-chain wallet that requires no app download - simply visit [app.joy.id](https://app.joy.id) in your browser to create and use it.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why is my wallet connection failing?">
Please check the following:

1. Make sure your wallet extension (e.g., MetaMask) is installed and unlocked
2. Ensure your browser allows the wallet extension to access the current page
3. Try refreshing the page and reconnecting
4. If using JoyID, make sure your browser supports WebAuthn
</Accordion>

## Voting Rights & Eligibility

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What do I need to prepare to participate in governance?">
To participate in DAO governance voting, you need to meet the following requirements:

1. **Connect a CKB Wallet** - Connect to the DAO platform using a supported wallet
2. **Create a Web5 DID** - Create your decentralized identity on the platform
3. **Deposit to Nervos DAO** - Your CKB wallet address (i.e., the wallet address you used to create Web5 DID) must have deposits in [NervDAO](https://nervdao.com), or you have bound a Neuron wallet deposit address in the DAO governance platform's profile center. See the binding tutorial 👉: [Bind NervosDAO Address](/en/docs/user-guide/getting-started/bind-nervosdao-address).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I deposited to Nervos DAO using Neuron wallet. Can I vote?">
Yes. You can bind the wallet address in Neuron that has locked CKB in Nervos DAO to your Web5 DID connected on the DAO platform, and you will also receive voting rights. For the binding process, please refer to 👉: [Bind NervosDAO Address](/en/docs/user-guide/getting-started/bind-nervosdao-address).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How is voting weight calculated?">
Voting weight is based on the amount of CKB you have deposited in Nervos DAO. The more CKB deposited, the greater your voting weight. Each Web5 DID corresponds to one Owner address, and each Owner address can bind multiple CKB wallet addresses. For a given Web5 DID, its voting weight equals the Nervos DAO balance of its Owner address plus the total Nervos DAO deposits of all bound CKB wallet addresses.

Example:
- Alice registers a Web5 DID named "alice" using JoyID wallet address A, and this wallet address A has deposited 100,000 CKB in Nervos DAO via nervdao.com.
- Additionally, Alice has deposited 500,000 CKB in Neuron wallet address B.
- Alice binds address B to her Web5 DID through the DAO platform.
Alice's total voting weight is:
100,000 CKB + 500,000 CKB = 600,000 CKB.

For detailed calculation rules, please refer to the [Voting Mechanism](/en/docs/meta-rule/voting-mechanism) documentation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is Web5 DID? Why is it needed?">
Web5 DID (Decentralized Identity) is a blockchain-based identity identifier. In the DAO platform, DID is used for:

- Uniquely identifying voter identity
- Preventing duplicate voting
- Associating your wallet addresses with voting records
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Who can vote?">
Voting in DAO v1.1 is implemented through smart contracts. When a proposal initiates voting, the system collects the Owner addresses (CKB addresses) corresponding to all currently registered Web5 DID accounts as the **voting whitelist**. Only Web5 DID accounts on the whitelist can participate in voting for that proposal.

Community members can bind their Nervos DAO addresses to whitelist addresses to increase their voting weight.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I just registered a Web5 DID. Why can't I participate in the current vote?">
This is because the voting whitelist is generated **when the proposal initiates voting**. If you register your Web5 DID after a proposal has already entered the voting stage, since the system did not collect your Web5 DID when voting was initiated, you cannot participate in that proposal's vote.

However, you can participate in future proposal votes, as long as you complete your Web5 DID registration before the new proposal initiates voting.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I ensure I can participate in voting?">
To ensure you can participate in voting, we recommend:

1. **Register Web5 DID early** - Complete registration before proposals you're interested in enter the voting stage
2. **Follow proposal progress** - Pay attention to proposals in the community review period and prepare before they enter the voting stage
3. **Bind Nervos DAO addresses** - Bind your Nervos DAO addresses containing CKB to your Web5 DID to obtain voting weight
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Proposals & Voting

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="How do I submit a proposal?">
Proposals go through the following process:

1. Create a proposal on the DAO platform, actively participate in community discussions and collect feedback
2. Refine the proposal content based on feedback
3. After meeting the community review period requirements, the proposer can choose whether to enter the project approval voting stage
4. Enter the project approval voting stage and await community voting results

<Callout title="Note" type="warning">
Once entering the project approval voting stage, the proposal has officially entered the decision-making process.
</Callout>


For detailed process, please refer to the [Proposal Lifecycle](/en/docs/meta-rule/proposal-lifecycle) documentation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long is the voting period?">
Voting periods vary by voting type:

| Voting Type | Duration |
|-------------|----------|
| Project Approval Voting | 7 days |
| Quick Confirmation Voting (Milestone Disbursement) | 3 days |
| Review Voting | 7 days |
| Final Arbitration Voting | 7 days |

For details, please refer to the [Voting Mechanism](/en/docs/meta-rule/voting-mechanism) documentation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I change my vote after voting?">
You can change your vote before the voting period ends. Once the voting period ends, the voting results are locked and cannot be changed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the conditions for a proposal to pass?">
A proposal must meet the following conditions to pass:

1. **Quorum**: The voting weight participation reaches the minimum threshold
2. **Approval Rate**: The proportion of approval votes exceeds the required percentage

Different types of proposals may have different passing conditions. For details, please refer to the [Voting Mechanism](/en/docs/meta-rule/voting-mechanism) documentation.
