## Setting Up Your Wallet

To participate in the CKB Community Fund DAO, you'll need a compatible wallet. The good news is that the DAO platform is built on [CCC (Common Chains Connector)](https://github.com/ckb-devrel/ccc), which supports a wide range of popular wallets. You can simply use your existing wallet.

### Supported Wallet Types
