## Why Deposit to Nervos DAO?

Depositing CKB into Nervos DAO is a prerequisite for participating in CKB Community Fund DAO governance voting. Only CKB that is locked in Nervos DAO grants you corresponding voting weight.

<Callout title="What is Nervos DAO?" type="info">
Nervos DAO is a smart contract on the CKB chain that allows users to lock CKB to receive interest compensation (offsetting dilution from secondary issuance). CKB deposited into Nervos DAO requires a lock-up period before it can be withdrawn.

## Important Notes After Depositing

### Lock-up Period

CKB deposited into Nervos DAO has a lock-up period (approximately 30 days). During the lock-up period, your CKB cannot be withdrawn, but you can still participate in DAO voting.

### Withdrawal Process

Withdrawing CKB from Nervos DAO requires two steps:
1. **Initiate Withdrawal Request** - Start the unlock process
2. **Complete Withdrawal** - After the lock-up period ends, complete the final withdrawal

### Voting Weight

Your voting weight equals the total amount of CKB that is **currently locked** in Nervos DAO. CKB that has initiated withdrawal but not yet completed does not count toward voting weight.
